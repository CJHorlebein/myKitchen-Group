### Project Overview:
Uses the Yummly recipe API, Firebase Login, and Firebase storage. Users are able to login to myKitchen using Firebase and see the ingredients currently available in their kitchen and add or remove items from their current kitchen inventory which is stored within their user information on firebase. They then can look up a recipe using the implemented Yummly API and compare the required ingredients against what they currently have available.
